# Preface {-}

This online book is serving as a study guide for students in my data journalism classes at the Cronkite School of Journalism. As we're learning, there are a lot of moving pieces and this serves to put it all together in one place. 

I'm grateful for all of the experts and teachers out there who have made their training materials open to the world, and helped build a wealth of materials for students of all types.
