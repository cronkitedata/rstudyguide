# Preface {-}

This online book is serving as a study guide for students in my data journalism classes at the Cronkite School of Journalism. Eventually, this will put together the resources for the whole class, but for now it just includes the section on learning R and R Markdown. 

I'm grateful for all of the experts and teachers out there who have made their training materials open to the world, and helped build a wealth of materials for students of all types. I've particularly leaned on Matt Waite, of the University of Nebraska and Jesse Lecy of Arizona State University, who generously share their course materials.


## Using the examples with packages {-}

When you start learning R, you'll realize that very little is done without packages. These have to be installed once per computer, or once per project if you're using the cloud version. This is just a list of all of the packages that have to be installed in one list.

* tidyverse
* rmarkdown
* lubridate
* janitor

Optional, for formatting things:

* DT
* knitr
* prettydocs
