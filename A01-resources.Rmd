# Great R Resources

## Key takeaways

* If this set of resources doesn't fit your learning style, there are lots of others that might
* In our class, we are working almost entirely in the "tidyverse", and in R Markdown documents. Some of the resources you'll find elsewhere might not.

## Coursework in R 

Other professors and universities are also trying to teach R in journalism and other classes. Here are a few that have particularly rich materials for their students: 

* Jesse Lecy's "Introduction to data science for the social sector,"  an ASU course that teaches R in the context of non-profit management. His site, <https://ds4ps.org/cpp-526-fall-2019/> has a [custom-made textbook](https://ds4ps.org/cpp-526-fall-2019/textbook/) that covers much of the same material as us. 

* Matt Waite at the University of Nebraska has been teach R in the context of a sports journalism class. [His textbook](http://mattwaite.github.io/sports/index.html) also has great resources and approaches to learning. One minor difference that might trip you up: We're using R Markdown, and he's using R Notebooks. They're very similar, but the "knit" option isn't there when you use Notebooks -- only a "Preview". You'll know what that means when we get moving.

## Instructional screencasts and videos

* Andrew Ba Tran's [R for Journalists](http://learn.r-journalism.com/en/) course, originall created for a MOOC offered by the  Knight Center for the Americas. Previous Cronkite students say that it goes a little fast for someone with no experience in other lanugages, but it has most of what you'd need.

* Ben Stenhaug, a Data Science for Social Good fellow at Stanford, has put together some screencasts and exercises called [teachR](https://teachingr.com/) on starting out in R and the tidyverse.

* "Tidy Tuesday" screencasts from David Robinson, [an example]((https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ)) using fivethirtyeight.com data on education and salaries. These are very long -- up to an hour -- but they walk through what it's really like to take a dataset from scratch and try to find something interesting. I disagree with one thing he does though -- I believe you should read the documentation FIRST, not after you've done a lot of guessing about what columns mean.

* Sharon Machliss' "[Do More with R](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D2RMSmRO9JOvPC1gbA8Mc3azvSfm8Vv)" YouTube series. These are fairly advanced single-topic, short videos.
