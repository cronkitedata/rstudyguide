# A quick tour of verbs

## Key takeaways 

* Verbs are functions; nouns are variables or objects.
* Do one thing at a time using the "and then" operator (`%>%`).
* You only really need a few verbs to get a lot done:
    * `select`, `filter`, `arrange`: Pick out and sort specific items
    * `group_by`, `summarise` : count and sum by category
    * `mutate` : create new columns with formulas
* You've probably done most of this before in Excel
* These are similar to other database languages such as SQL. 


This chapter will go through the very basics of each verb. Subsequent chapters will go into more detail on how to make them work in a variety of circumstances. 

### Data for this walkthrough {-}

All of these sections will be based on the 2017-2018 [Arizona immunization data](https://cronkitedata.github.io/cronkite-docs/assets/data/xlexamples/2017-arizona-reporting-schools-coverage.xlsx). The data was downloaded from the [Arizona Department of Health](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/immunization/index.php#reports-immunization-coverage). The link for "Arizona Reporting Schools Coverage" under each year is the Excel file.

The following changes were made to the original file: 

1. Remove any specific immunizations other than MMR, for measles
2. Remove schools with under 20 students, for which the state did not report any data individually. It accounted for `r 1021-908` schools, or about 10 percent of the schools. Estimating all of those schools at their maximum possible (19), it would account for about 2.5 percent of the students. 
3. Estimate the number of children in each category by multiplying the percentage by the enrollment. There is room for rounding error in this. 


Variable name | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- 
school_name | chr | upper case
address | chr | upper case
city | chr | upper case
zip_code | chr | 5-digit zip code, leading 0 if needed
school_nurse | chr | "YES"/"NO"
school_type | chr | "PUBLIC" / "CHARTER" / "PRIVATE"
enrolled | num | 6th grade enrollment
num_immune_mmr | num | # of immunized students for measles
num_exempt_mmr | num | # of student exempt from requirement for measles
num_compliance_mmr | num | total of immune + exempt (in compliance with rules)
num_pbe | num | # with personal believe exempt. for at least 1 immunization
num_medical_exempt | num | # who have a medical exemption for at least 1 immunization
num_pbe_exempt_all | num | # who have personal believe exemption for every shot

Note: It seems that some students who *could* be exempt from mmr get it anyway -- there are cases in which there are larger numbers with pbe exemptions for all immunizations than the number with mmr exemptions.

### The `%>%` operator: ... and then... {-}

The tidyverse encourages you to do your work one step at a time. Instead of packing everything into one command, stack them by saying "start here, and then.. and then .. etc."  

    grade6_counts %>%            # start with the data frame, AND THEN...
        select (school_name) %>%     # pick out the school name only AND THEN ...
        arrange (school_name)        # put them in alphabetical order

##  Looking at your data in pieces and in order

### `select` to pick out columns

In Excel, there was no easy way to filter data *vertically*. We could only filter rows. The `select` verb picks out specific columns. Rename them at the same time by putting the new name on the left side of an equal sign: 

```{r}
grade6_counts %>%
    select ( school = school_name,
             county, 
             enrolled) %>%
    head(3)
   
```

### `arrange` to sort 

In Excel, the "Sort" menu item is used to arrange data alphabetically or in numeric order. That's confusing, because "sorting" can be construed a lot of different ways. For instance, you might "sort" M&Ms into their colors. 

But in R, the verb is "arrange", which is much clearer conceptually. The `arrange` verb puts the rows in order based on the column or columns you specify. 

This arranges the data from the highest to lowest enrollment by using the `desc` indicator. You can have more than one column, which takes over when there's a tie.

```{r}
grade6_counts %>%
    select ( school = school_name,
             county, 
             enrolled) %>%
    arrange ( desc(enrolled)) %>%
    head(3)


```

### `filter` to pick out rows

This is one place where the Excel terminology carries over to R. There is a whole chapter on filtering -- it can get quite sophisticated -- but just remember that it is much more picky than you're accustomed to.  The computer sees *MARICOPA* as a completely different word than *Maricopa*, for example. 

Use two equals sign to test for a match (`==`) : and they have to match exactly.

```{r paged.print=TRUE}
grade6_counts %>%
    select (school_name, enrolled) %>%
    filter ( school_name == "AMPHITHEATER MIDDLE SCHOOL")

```

## `group_by` and `summarise` to count and sum

The group_by and summarise command is just like a pivot table, but it has a lot more power when you get to know it.  At its simplest, it does just what a pivot table does: 

![](images/30-pivot-to-summary.png)

`group_by` puts each row into categories, such as the school types above. `summarise` calculates summary statistics such as counts -- or `n()` -- and sums: 

```{r}

grade6_counts %>%
    filter ( county == "MARICOPA") %>%
    group_by ( school_type ) %>%
    summarise ( sum (enrolled),
                n()
    ) 
     
```

## `mutate` to calculate something new

The verb `mutate` means to take old information and turn it into a new column. The most obvious example in this data is to get the schools with the lowest immunization rates:

```{r}

grade6_counts %>%
    mutate (pct_immune = (num_immune_mmr / enrolled) * 100) %>%
    arrange (pct_immune) %>%
    select  (school_name, pct_immune, num_immune_mmr, enrolled) %>%
    head(10)

```

Note that the percentage has to be multiplied by 100 -- there is no simple formatting that will keep the numbers in tact the way there was in Excel. Don't worry about the ugly numbers for now -- you'll see ways to improve on that later.

## `join` to merge tables together by column

Sometimes you need to apply information from one data frame to another. Some examples include :

* Adding demographics to geographic information, such as county level data, from Census
* Converting codes to words, such as Zip Code to town name.
* Finding rows that match across two data frames, such as contributors to a campaign and contractors. (This is often hard)
* Creating standardization tables to fix spelling and other issues in an existing dataset.
* Linking information from one unit of analysis (say, companies) to another (say, inspections or violations)

See the chapter on joining for more details. For now, just knowing it exists is all you need.
